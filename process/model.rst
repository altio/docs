Software Development Model
==========================

* Preference: Iterative and Agile *

Why not Waterfall?
------------------

The requirements process for software is simply not the same as in other
engineering disciplines. When a building is constructed, decisions are made
upfront about if and where bathrooms, elevators, escalators, services, and
usable spaces will be placed.  If everyone suddenly had flying cars and
wanted to be able to park in pods adjacent to their apartments and offices,
exactly 0% of buildings currently under construction would be able to adapt.
On the other hand, *most* non-embedded software is a living entity, taking on
an identity much different than anticipated by either the product owner or the
developer at the time of inception.

What you mean, "iterative and agile?"
-------------------------------------

Agile means a lot of things to a lot of people.  For some it means "sprints,"
for others it means "stand-ups," for others it means "being flexible."  This
is because agile is a methodology a team applies to an otherwise sound model
to help make it more responsive.  It is this author's opinion that most teams
are naturally extending a spiral or iterative model when they say they are an
agile team, so "iterative and agile" seeks to be explicit.
