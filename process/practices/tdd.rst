Test-Driven Development (TDD)
=============================

For a well-defined task, writing a test (which will fail as a result of being
unimplemented or a bug) and then modifying the code to satisfy the test does
two things:

1. Makes validation of desired end-state easier to confirm.
2. Leaves behind a test to prevent regression.
