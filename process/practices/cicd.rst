Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD), and Continuous Deployment
================================================================================

Notionally these are all things to strive for that provide needed support
infrastructure for agile development.  Continuous integration ensures that
builds happen, tests pass, and docs are generated.  Continuous Delivery
ensures that artifacts and releaseable, built code are reliably generated as
a by-product of each commit when the CI process has completed.  Finally,
depending on a project's design paradigm, continuous (or otherwise automated)
deployment may happen when certain criteria are statisfied (e.g. a branch or
tag regular expression has a match).
